Hello, you found it! This is the place to file issues or ask questions about the Stamen map tiles.

As of July 2023, Stamen is partnering with [Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/). Stamen will continue to design and maintain the iconic designs behind Toner, Terrain, and Watercolor, while Stadia will manage and run the tile service you use to get our maps. Please [set up an account](https://client.stadiamaps.com/signup/) and [follow these instructions](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/guides/migrating-from-stamen-map-tiles/#create-a-stadia-maps-account) to continue using Stamen map tiles. 

If you are writing to tell us about missing tiles or information that is missing our out of date on our maps, we have good news! You can expect to see all of these issues resolved in the next couple of weeks, as part of the migration of our tile services to Stadia Maps.

Watercolor is the exception, as we do not have a funding source and are unsure of the timeline for when we will be able to rebuild it, which would be the only way to fix the data and missing tiles. Luckily, the Smithsonian Institution has graciously undertaken to [preserve and support Watercolor in it's original form](https://watercolormaps.collection.cooperhewitt.org/#12/40.7847/-73.9574). 

If you have noticed some other change in the Stamen Map Tiles or are experiencing a sudden loss of service, that is unexpected! Please create an issue and tell us about it.

If you have a question about a website, software library, application, or other project that is currently relying on Stamen for the tiling service and are not able to set up an account and migrate it, please file a ticket and let us know. 

If you checking up on an issue you filed relating to internet or browser protocols, we expect you should no longer be experiencing this issue. Please [set up an account with Stadia Maps](https://client.stadiamaps.com/signup/) and follow this [migration guide](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/guides/migrating-from-stamen-map-tiles/) to ensure you do not experience any service disruptions.

To everyone else who has already filed a ticket and is waiting for a response, please accept our apologies! In the ten years since we created this demo website, we have never been able to keep up with the inquiries and demand. For ongoing support, please [create an account](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/guides/migrating-from-stamen-map-tiles/#create-a-stadia-maps-account), and then visit the [Migration Guide for Stamen Map Tile Users](https://docs.stadiamaps.com/guides/migrating-from-stamen-map-tiles/) for instructions on how to switch over to the new and improved services.
